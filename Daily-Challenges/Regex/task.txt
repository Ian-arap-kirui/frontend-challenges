In this lab, you will work with Regular Expressions in JavaScript to solve different text manipulation challenges.

Make sure that you're familiar with the Regular Expressions before attempting this challenge. This is a prerequisite to complete the mentioned challenges

Challenges
Matching phone numbers in a given format.
If a given String contains a phone number of 10 digits you would have to format the string in the format of xxx xxx xxxx (with the mentioned spaces)
Replacing URLs in a text string.
If the given string contains a valid url, return a new string by replacing the valid url with URL_REPLACED
Counting the number of words in a text string.
Return the count of the number of words present in the inputted string.
Removing extra spaces between words in a text string.
If the given string contains any extra spaces between words including traililng and leading spaces. All of them should be removed and return a proper string.
For each challenge, you have to write the code in the desired function from the given boilerplate code.

Hint: Use JavaScript's built-in string methods like match(), replace(), split(), and trim() along with Regular Expressions to complete this lab.
